This project demonstrates the power of Microsoft Power BI in transforming raw survey data into actionable insights. It features an interactive dashboard built using a real-world dataset of over 600 responses from data professionals. The project covers every aspect of data analytics, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, providing a comprehensive view of global job trends, salary variations, programming preferences, and satisfaction metrics.

# Key Features

# Data Cleaning & Transformation:

- Standardized text data for consistency (e.g., job titles).
- Converted salary ranges into numeric averages for accurate analysis.
- Mapped textual satisfaction scores to numeric values for aggregation and ranking.

# Advanced Visualizations:
- Cards for high-level KPIs (e.g., total respondents, average age).
- Bar charts to compare average salaries across job roles and regions.
- Tree maps to highlight programming language preferences.
- Geographic maps for global salary trends.
- Gauge visualizations to depict satisfaction metrics like work-life balance and salary satisfaction.

# Interactive Features:

- Drill-down capabilities for demographic or geographic insights.

# Insights Delivered
- Regional salary disparities: Data scientists in the U.S. earn $139,000 on average compared to $68,000 in India.
- Python as the most popular programming language among professionals.
- Moderate work-life balance satisfaction (5.74/10) and low salary satisfaction (4.25/10).
- Geographic trends showcasing salary variations influenced by living costs.
